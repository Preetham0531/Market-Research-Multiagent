# Multi-Agent Market Research System — Detailed Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents a production-grade, AI-powered multi-agent system that automates industry/company research, generates high-impact AI/GenAI use cases, and maps each use case to high-quality datasets and resources (Kaggle, HuggingFace, GitHub). The platform delivers decision-ready insights, accelerates strategy, and de-risks AI initiatives.

## Objectives
- Automate end-to-end market research and AI opportunity discovery
- Generate 10 distribution-constrained development use cases per company/industry
- Curate 3–6 high-relevance resources per use case with balanced platform mix
- Provide a UX-ready Streamlit interface and exportable outputs (Excel/Markdown)
- Ensure security, resilience, and auditability of the workflow

## Architecture Overview
- Orchestrator coordinates specialized agents (Research, Use Case, Resource)
- LLM backbone uses GPT-4o via LangChain for reasoning and structured outputs
- Tavily for advanced web search; Kaggle/HuggingFace/GitHub SDKs for resources
- Streamlit frontend with chatbot, analysis panels, and downloads
- Outputs: JSON reports, `datasets.md`, Excel exports, and this `report.md`

## Agents and Responsibilities
- Research Agent: Validates input → web search (Tavily) → structured company/industry analysis with citations
- Use Case Agent: Generates 10 detailed use cases (50% AI/ML, 30% GenAI, 20% other) + citations; provides prioritization and GenAI solutions
- Resource Agent: Extracts keywords → searches Kaggle/HF/GitHub → dedupes → enforces 40/30/30 mix → outputs clickable resources

## Data Flow
1) Company input → Orchestrator triggers Research Agent
2) Research output → Use Case Agent → formatted, constraint-checked use cases
3) Use cases → Resource Agent → curated datasets/resources per use case
4) Results persisted as JSON/Markdown/Excel; chatbot answers over the full context

## Methodology
- Prompt engineering with LangChain PromptTemplate and OutputParser
- AutoGen-style generate–check–rewrite loop for constraint enforcement
- Relevance scoring and canonicalization for resources; platform mix policy
- Security hardening: input sanitization, path normalization, error sanitization

## Key Features
- Full-power Tavily: advanced depth, maximum results
- Robust parsers for multiple use case formats; safe UI rendering
- Excel exports with newline-separated URLs; UI with clickable HTML anchors
- Implementation roadmap generation with phased tasks and durations

## Results Snapshot
- Average runtime: minutes per company (depends on search volume)
- Use cases: 10 detailed, distribution-compliant per run
- Resources: 3–6 per use case; enforced Kaggle/HF/GitHub mix
- Chatbot: Answers over Research + Use Cases + Resources + Roadmap

## Security & Reliability
- `.env` validation and auto-cleaning on startup
- Path traversal prevention and file size guards
- Sensitive error sanitization; graceful fallbacks where applicable

## How to Use
1. Configure API keys in `.env` (OpenAI, Tavily; optional: Kaggle, HF, GitHub)
2. Run Streamlit app and enter a company name
3. Use Start Analysis or Quick Analysis Download
4. Explore Company Overview, Development Use Cases, Resources, and Implementation Plan
5. Download Excel/Markdown outputs

## Notable Design Choices
- Deterministic format via structured parsing for reliability
- Separation of concerns across agents; orchestration with fallbacks
- Clickable resource links rendered as HTML anchors with target="_blank"

## Business Impact
- Time savings: replace multi-hour manual research with minutes
- Quality: standardized, citation-backed outputs and curated resources
- Adoption readiness: implementation plans and KPIs included by default

## Future Enhancements
- Optional RAG over company documents for deeper customization
- Caching and vector search for repeated queries
- Team collaboration features (Slack/Teams integrations)

## Appendix: Outputs
- `reports/*.json`: full machine-readable analysis
- `datasets.md`: per-use-case resource table with clickable anchors
- Quick Excel: use cases, enhanced descriptions, raw URL references
